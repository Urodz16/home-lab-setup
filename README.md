# Home Lab Setup: Windows Domain and Kali Linux

## Overview
This project documents the setup of a home lab environment with:
- A Windows Domain Controller (Active Directory).
- A Windows workstation joined to the domain.
- A Kali Linux machine used for attack simulations.

The lab serves as a platform for learning Active Directory administration and analyzing cybersecurity attack scenarios.

## Objectives
- Configure a secure Windows domain environment.
- Simulate cybersecurity attacks using Kali Linux.
- Analyze logs and improve defenses.

## Structure
- `documentation/`: Guides and setup instructions.
- `configurations/`: Configuration files for the VMs.
- `diagrams/`: Network topology and workflow diagrams.
- `examples/`: Logs and outputs from the lab.

## Key Features
- Active Directory domain with user and group management.
- Attack simulations using tools like Nmap and Metasploit.
- Log analysis with Windows Event Viewer.

## Getting Started
1. Install VirtualBox.
2. Set up the VMs following the [Lab Setup Guide](documentation/lab-setup-guide.md).
3. Simulate attacks and analyze logs.
